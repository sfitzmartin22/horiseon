# Your Project Title
Horiseon

## Description
This project's goal is to take an existing website's code and refactor it to make it both accessible and more concise.  The benefits of making a site more accessible are numerous, a few of which include: making the website avoilable to be consumed by all people with access to the internet as well as making the website easier to find on a search engine.  In this project, I added semantic tags in order for people who use a screen reader to be able to read the site in a structure that makes sense and is coherent.  This enables the person that consumes this information to be able to hop around to various sections, headers, titles, footers etc.  I also included alt tags on all the pictures in order to allow eyesight impaired individuals to get the full experience of the site.
